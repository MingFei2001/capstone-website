## Introduction

The capstone project requires a website used to promote the business in our business case.

The website should include the following:
1. Home page (index.html)
    - nav bar, main body
2. Promotional media material
    - videos, images, graphs
3. API for some data relevant to the business
    - e.g. exchange rate, weather, news
4. Database for storing structured data
    - e.g. user data, travel plan, financial details, media file path
5. others

## Point of focus
1. The website should be simple and straightforward
    - for easier management and maintainance
2. The backend should be linux based and tools should be available in most linux distro
    - for easier configuration and maintainance
3. The ideal page numbers should not be more than 5 webpages
    - best to be 1 or 2 pages only
