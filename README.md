## Introduction
The capstone project requires a website used to promote the business in our business case.

Here is the website structure:
1. Homepage - index.html
2. Contact - Contact.html
3. About - About.html
4. Listing - listing.html

Here is the component needed for the business infrastructure:
1. Web Server
2. Database
3. Media Hosting
4. Networking (not in this repo)
5. Security (not in this repo)

## Point of focus
1. The website should be simple and straightforward
    - for easier management and maintainance
2. The backend should be linux based and tools should be available in most linux distro
    - for easier configuration and maintainance
3. The ideal page numbers should not be more than 5 webpages
    - best to be 1 or 2 pages only
